# Hi - Lo Assembly Game
That is a simple ARM32 Assembly written Hi-Lo card game, which takes two integer inputs. Eeach number represents a card and each card have it's strenght.
The program just compares the numbers and then retunrs a string which tells the user which card is stronger/weaker. The idea of writing a small game in 
Assembly was to teach some basics about CPU archtecthure Learning a low level leanguge gave me the oppurtunity to understand in depth the core conspets
of programming, as you have to declare and wirite the code behing all the simple tasks that are already pre-written for you in most of the programming leanuages.

To run the code you should use AQA Simulation tool from that link:
